## The Vibe

This is **not a startup**. Not a side hustle. Not a serious DeFi project.

This is a **batshit creative experiment** treating chairs with absurd reverence and occasional financial chaos.

This guy can't ship if he was born ragnar. 

If it flops → we had fun and learned token mechanics.  
If it works → we're the idiots who turned sitting into a cult.

Either way, the chairs get their moment.
