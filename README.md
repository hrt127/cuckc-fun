## Quick Start

Prototype currently lives in `index.html` (CDN/inline).  
Future React/Vite app will go under `src/`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hrt127/cuckc-fun.git
cd cuckc-fun
# open index.html in a browser, or run your own static server

MIT – go build your own furniture empire, or fork the cult.
