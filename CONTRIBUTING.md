# Contributing to SIT OR SWIPE

Love the chair cult? Want to add your own cursed/profiled seat?

## Easiest way: add a chair profile

1. Open `src/data/chairs.js`
2. Copy an existing object
3. Fill in your savage bio, tags, vibe
4. Find a high-res image URL (Unsplash, manufacturer site, meme edit ok)
5. Give it the next `id`
6. Open a PR titled "Add [Chair Name] – [short description]"

See [docs/CHAIR-SUBMISSION.md](docs/CHAIR-SUBMISSION.md) for full template + examples.

## Other ways to help

- Improve swipe physics / mobile feel
- Add new sounds / stamps
- Bug fixes (especially touch gestures)
- Tokenomics / wallet integration ideas
- Promo assets (memes, video scripts, X thread drafts)
- Documentation polish

No minimum PR size. Even tiny additions are welcome.  
Vibe check: keep it savage, absurd, X-native.
