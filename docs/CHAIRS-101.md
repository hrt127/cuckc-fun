# Chairs 101: From Ancient Thrones to Golden Madness
## (Or: How Your Ass Became the Main Character in History's Longest Sitcom)

**A no-BS, mildly deranged guide to the furniture that shaped civilization, flexed power, wrecked backs, and occasionally triggered existential crises.**

Featuring sneaky Saffa flexes, iconic legends, and the Latin insanity ladder that started it all.

Let's sit down.

### 1. Ancient Thrones – When Sitting Meant You Were Literally Above Everyone Else

Chairs didn't start as IKEA flat-packs.  
They began as power props.

**Ancient Egypt (~3100 BC):** Pharaohs parked their divine behinds on gilded thrones with lion/panther legs, falcon heads, and enough gold to bankrupt a small nation. Everyone else? Floor, mat, or a low stool if they were lucky. Sitting = elevation = god-king status.

Same deal in Greece (klismos chairs with those elegant curved legs) and Rome. A proper chair wasn't furniture. It was a billboard screaming "I outrank you."

### 2. Medieval Flex – One Big Chair to Rule Them All

Fast-forward to the Middle Ages. Chairs are still ultra-rare. The lord/host gets one massive, carved, immovable beast at the head of the table. Everyone else? Benches or the floor like loyal serfs.

That single chair wasn't about comfort. It was hierarchy porn. You sit in it, you rule the room.

Portable X-frame or folding stools existed for travel/war, but they were still status accessories. No one was "chilling". They were broadcasting dominance.

### 3. Cape Dutch & Saffa Roots – Where the Real Adaptation Started

While Europe was busy carving rococo nonsense, Dutch settlers at the Cape (1652 onward) had to deal with actual heat, wood shortages, and a frontier life.

Enter **riempie** furniture. Rawhide thongs woven into seats instead of cane → breathable, cheap to repair, termite-resistant, perfect for hot stoeps and long wagon treks. Often paired with local stinkwood (dark, fragrant, hard as hell) or yellowwood.

These weren't fancy. They were clever. Lightweight, ventilated, durable. The spiritual ancestor of every modern outdoor chair that doesn't make you sweat your soul out.

**Honourable mention:** the rusbank (settle bench) and riempie dining chairs still made today. Saffa design DNA: practical beauty born from necessity.

### 4. Industrial Revolution – The Chair Airdrop

1800s. Michael Thonet cracks steam-bending beech wood. The No. 14 café chair is born: six pieces, ten screws, two nuts, flat-packed, shipped worldwide. Over 50 million produced.

Suddenly cafés, homes, and bad first dates everywhere have the same chair. Democratization achieved. Sitting goes from elite luxury → mass commodity.

---

### 5. 20th Century Magic – When Chairs Became Art & Science

Bauhaus brings tubular steel → clean, minimal, industrial. Eames drops molded plywood/plastic → organic comfort for the everyman. Ergonomics enters the chat because office workers start breaking their backs in cubicles.

Meanwhile in SA: riempie tradition quietly evolves into modern outdoor pieces (shoutout Haldane Martin's colourful, joyful collections – Cape Town summer in chair form).

### 6. Practical Classification – What the Hell Are You Even Sitting On?

- **Side/dining** (straight, armless, polite)
- **Armchairs** (club, wingback – hug you back)
- **Office/task** (adjustable hell or heaven)
- **Lounge/recliners** (pure hedonism)
- **Stools** (bar, counter, low indigenous vibes)
- **Outdoor** (braai-proof)
- **Specials:** gaming thrones, barber chairs, director's slates, rocking chairs that judge you

Pick your poison.

---

### 7. Materials – Where the Real Lies Live

- **Wood** = warm, fixable, ages like fine wine (if solid)
- **Metal** = strong, stackable, cold bitch energy
- **Plastic** = immortal, cheap, everywhere (Monobloc supremacy)
- **Upholstery** = the comfort layer that hides a multitude of sins

**Rule #1:** Trash frame = trash chair. No velvet can save particleboard.

---

### 8. Ergonomics – Don't Let Your Chair Murder You Slowly

- Feet flat. Knees ~90°
- Hips slightly higher than knees
- Lumbar supported (not just a curve – actual nest)
- Elbows ~90°, screen eye-level
- Move every 30–60 min. Dynamic sitting > perfect statue pose

Even riempie chairs encourage shifting. No slouching allowed, boet.

### 9. Hall of Fame – The Chairs That Changed Everything

- **Thonet No. 14** – mass production GOAT
- **Barcelona** – Mies van der Rohe chrome + leather luxury
- **Eames Lounge & Ottoman** – ultimate chill
- **Tulip** – Saarinen, no leg clutter
- **Panton** – first all-plastic cantilever
- **Wishbone CH24** – Wegner Danish elegance
- **Haldane Martin Hula** – Saffa outdoor joy bomb

**Honourable Saffa nods:** classic riempie chairs (17th–19th c. Cape heritage – lightweight pioneers) and modern colourful twists.

### 10. Chairs as Culture – Frozen Assumptions About Who You Are

Every chair whispers its era's values:
- Power
- Tech
- Comfort priorities
- Status flex
- Back pain tolerance
- Braai logistics

Your current seat is telling on you.

### 11. The Insanity Ladder – How We Got Here

It started as a joke meme:

1. **insolitvs mente** → simple wooden kitchen chair
2. **mente vesanvs** → basic black office chair
3. **prorsvs insanvs** → plush burgundy velvet armchair
4. **demens prorsus et mente vesanvs** → absurd golden lion-armed throne

Comfort escalates. Sanity collapses. Peak lunacy = throne-tier.
