# CUCKC.FUN - Long romantic sessions under the moonlight 

**One-pager for collaborators**

## What It Is

Tinder for chairs. Swipe on iconic furniture (Saffa legends + global icons + cursed archetypes), match with your soulmate, earn $CUCKC tokens, join the chair empire.

Not a startup. Not a side hustle. A batshit creative experiment treating chairs with absurd reverence and occasional financial chaos. Definitely not about cucks. 

Cooking up more elaborate hamster wheel actual value generating economy. I will find not let you down brrrr man.

## Current State (Feb 2026)

✅ **Working prototype** - React app, swipe physics, sounds, 5 chairs  *1+1 = 5 cuckc?
✅ **$CUCKC token tracker** - UI only (earn 1-10 per match, lose up to 100 on bad decisions) *wtf this aint 
✅ **Viral mechanics** - Confetti, reaction stamps (SOLID!, KAREN DETECTED), fart sounds  *fokkol! nada. niks. expressive in all the languages 
✅ **GitHub repo** - Public, MIT license, ready to clone  

**Live demo:** Coming in 48hrs (pending Vercel deploy)

## The Opportunity

### Immediate (This Week)
- X thread series → drive traffic → gauge interest *got cuckedcunts presents: Chairs 101 and follow up episodes cucked and ready to eyes wide shut
- Share with design/CT Twitter for feedback
- Refine token economics based on initial reactions *refine a new world order submit to mommy economics to be engineered. it's here in my head. just gotta flesh it out. 

### Short-term (Next Month)
- Deploy real $CUCKC token (Base or Solana) *fucking snipers. wanna have a look at CCA auctions on Uniswap. Also what clankr can provide. or one of those sol launchers. or even maybe the glazed cunts. 
- Airdrop to early users (track via localStorage claims) *be generous daddy, we look after our community. i just wanna live basic, don't want much myself. i do wanna compete in the 2030 winter olympics tho in france. soooo...let's not be useless
- Community chair submissions + voting DAO *fucking dao's, but yea. after the great cucking at least research how to do this shit properly

### Mid-term (3-6 Months)
- IRL activations (Design Indaba pop-up, stoep parties) *fuck yes! cuckc meetups 
- Brand partnerships (Haldane Martin collab, merch drops) *I can see them loving it :) 
- NFT badge minting (proof of taste on-chain) *using all our wits and bera trauma feetpics exp. valuable things only

### Long-term (If It Works)
- Full chair marketplace (swipe → buy IRL links) *cuckc creaming themselves rn
- Prediction markets (bet on weekly most-swiped chairs) *okay im wet 
- Franchise the concept (Tinder for other absurd categories) *hmmmm moth.fun meth.fun cunts.fun snowzies.cunt

## Why This Could Work

1. **Zero competition** - Literally no one doing this *watch me whip some endeavoured cunt probz just did
2. **Built-in shareability** - People WILL screenshot matches *drome will force it down their throats haha
3. **Meme-native** - Crypto degens + design nerds both get it *got 2 bro's on solana I wanna involve. they are the best
4. **Saffa authenticity** - We actually care about chairs + culture *some might say we are the most welcoming friendly people there is. go bokke
5. **Low downside, high jol** - If it flops, we had fun. If it works, we're legends. *dining with the virgins and having holey holes as far as the eyes can be incredulous

## What I Need From You

**Your superpower:** [Fill in - design? dev? marketing? network? poker brain for economy? cunty?]

**Time commitment:** 2-4hrs/week to start (spikes when launching) *what the planner th0t. but i'm not demanding on your time. I can be effort, im tryna focus it topical nd good. just point me to the chair if im ever too much. i listen. i promise

**Your cut:** 50/50 on everything between the agreed on hoskins' (token allocation, revenue, IP, braai invites) 

**Immediate asks:**
- Review working prototype (test on phone + desktop)
- Feedback on chair profiles (too absurd? not absurd enough?)
- Token economy design input (your gambling/game theory expertise)
- Help decide: Base or Solana for token launch? Fogo? rugmedaddyeuko knows best

## Next 30 Days If You're In

**Week 1:** Refine app, deploy live, soft launch to design Twitter  
**Week 2:** Meme campaign (Chairs 101 thread, Latin escalation, teaser posts)  
**Week 3:** Token mechanics finalized, presale strategy decided  
**Week 4:** Launch decision (go live or pivot based on traction)

---

## The Vibe

This is **not** about "disrupting the furniture industry" or "building the Tinder for X."

This is about:
- Making people laugh until they snort 
- Then making them emotionally attached to a fucking chair
- Then maybe making some money if the stars align and we hamster wheel good 
- And definitely i'd like to 1day maybe do weird asmr things irl with my internet friends

If it works → we're the idiots who turned sitting into a cult  *pretty sure they already cult kinda good cuckc
If it flops → we try my orgy build. i finally kinda get ohm and so many things. this past year I was plenty an idiot and so stupid. there is good that can cum outa learning shit from all that. do it having proper moisturised playful lane 

Either way, the chairs get their moment. immma enjoying myself at long last again. berachain's biggest troll 1 french asting once told his fellow frenchies. fml they bad at french haha

## Decision Time

**Reply with:**
- "I'm in" (let's build this batshit empire)
- "Show me more" (need to see working demo first)
- "You're insane but I love it" (in but cautiously)
- "Pass" (no hard feelings, respect the honesty)
- STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO REPLY WITH just do it. do what? PUT IT IN FOR HEAVENS SAKE 

If you're in, next steps:
1. I send you live demo link 
2. You test + give brutal feedback
3. We design token economics together
4. We pick launch date and go full send
5. we do the clever calculated no emotions clinical, moral compassed intact.
