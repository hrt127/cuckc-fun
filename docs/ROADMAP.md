## Week 3: Economy Design (Feb 19-25)

**Goal:** Finalize token mechanics before launch

**Core decisions:**
- [ ] Swipe cost? (Free vs daily limit vs token ante)
- [ ] Match rewards? (Fixed vs variable vs skill-based)
- [ ] Premium mechanics? (Unlock rare chairs, undo swipes, boosts)
- [ ] Gambling layer? (Prediction markets, tournaments, options)

**Token structure:**
- [ ] Choose chain (Base vs Solana)
- [ ] Allocation (30% community, 20% LP, 50% team/future)
- [ ] Vesting schedule
- [ ] Airdrop criteria (early swipers, referrals)

**Backend:**
- [ ] API for balance tracking
- [ ] Wallet connection (MetaMask/Phantom)
- [ ] Claim flow for airdrops

**Output:** TOKENOMICS.md finalized

---

## Week 4: Launch Prep (Feb 26 - Mar 4)

**Goal:** Deploy token OR pivot based on traction

**If traction good (>5k visitors, >100 matches):**
- [ ] Deploy token contract
- [ ] Set up LP
- [ ] Airdrop snapshot
- [ ] Launch announcement
- [ ] Community Telegram/Discord

**If traction weak:**
- [ ] Pivot to pure meme (no token)
- [ ] Focus on viral content
- [ ] Build organic community first
- [ ] Revisit token in 3 months

**Output:** Live token OR decision to wait

---

## Phase 2: Community (Month 2)

- [ ] Chair submission portal
- [ ] Voting DAO (retire chairs, add legends)
- [ ] Leaderboards (top matchers, highest balance)
- [ ] NFT badge minting (proof of taste)
- [ ] Referral system

---

## Phase 3: IRL Chaos (Months 3-6)

- [ ] Design Indaba pop-up
- [ ] Haldane Martin collab
- [ ] Stoep party tour (bring your fave chair, get judged)
- [ ] QR code merch drops
- [ ] "Real Haldane chair" giveaway for top holder

## Success Metrics

**Week 1:** 100+ visitors, 500+ swipes  
**Week 2:** 1k+ visitors, viral screenshot  
**Week 3:** Economy design approved by poker brain friend  
**Week 4:** Token deployed OR clear pivot decision  

**Month 2:** 10k+ visitors, 100+ daily active

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** No one cares  
**Mitigation:** Pure jol anyway, learned token mechanics

**Risk:** Token launch flops  
**Mitigation:** Don't presale, just airdrop + LP, low expectations

**Risk:** Can't afford domain  
**Mitigation:** Use .vercel.app until funding, begging mommy, or partner fronts

**Risk:** Friend too busy or just generally in their cunt era
**Mitigation:** Ship solo, invite him when traction proven

---

## Non-Negotiables

- wtf is with this no nut negotioables 
- Always memetic% more absurd than necessary
- don't fucking casper 
- If someone doesn't get joke, fine - dey anus will fomo soon enough
