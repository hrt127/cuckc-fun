## Core Philosophy

we do what euko suggests after after voicechannel
 
A **meme token with economic consequences**

Sitting has value. Taste has value. Absurdity has value. 
$CUCKC quantifies all three. 

---

## Layer 1: Core Loop (Free to Play)

**Swipes:** FREE (unlimited)  
**Matches earn:**
- Standard chair: **1 $CUCKC**
- Saffa Legend (#SaffaLegend tag): **10 $CUCKC**
- Perfect match streak (3+ in row): **2x multiplier**

**Rejections cost:**

---

## Layer 2: Hamster Wheel Mechanics

### Loss Aversion
- Rejecting Monobloc = instant -100 CUCKC
- Creates fear → users swipe right more often → more engagement
- "I'm scared to reject anything now" = desired state

### Sunk Cost
- After earning 50+ CUCKC, unlocking premium feels "cheap"
- After 100+ CUCKC, you're "invested" and keep swiping
- Streaks create FOMO (break streak = lose 2x multiplier)

### Variable Rewards
- Standard match: 1 CUCKC (predictable)
- Legend match: 10 CUCKC (rare dopamine spike)
- Mystery chair (1% spawn rate): 50-500 CUCKC (jackpot)

### Social Proof
- Leaderboard: Top 10 matchers visible
- "X just matched with Haldane and earned 10 CUCKC"
- Shareable match cards with balance flex

## Layer 4: Gambling/Speculation (Your Poker Brain Here)

### Prediction Markets
**"Which chair will be most swiped this week?"**
- Bet 10 CUCKC on your prediction
- Winners split the pot (minus 5% rake to treasury)
- Creates meta-game: Do I match what I like or what others will?

### Chair Tournaments
- Entry: 100 CUCKC
- Prize pool: All entry fees
- Format: 20 chairs, best matcher (highest score) wins
- Scoring: Legends = 10pts, Standard = 1pt, Monobloc reject = -10pts

### Options/Futures (INSANE BUT MAYBE?)
- "Lock in right to match with chair later"
- Example: Pay 20 CUCKC now to guarantee Haldane appears in your deck tomorrow
- Creates scarcity + hedging behavior
- Too complex? Maybe Phase 2.

### Staking
- Lock 100 CUCKC for 7 days = earn 1% daily (7% total)

- Early unstake = 10% penalty (goes to LP)

## Chain Decision: Base vs Solana

### Base (Ethereum L2)
**Pros:**
- Normie-friendly (Coinbase UX)
- Lower fees than mainnet
- EVM = more devs

**Cons:**
- Still higher fees than Solana
- Slower confirmation times

### Solana
**Pros:**
- Meme coin native (Bonk, Myro vibes)
- Near-zero fees
- Fast confirmation = instant swipe rewards

**Cons:**
- Phantom wallet less normie-friendly
- Degen culture might overshadow design nerds

**Recommendation:** **Solana** (meme energy + speed + fees align with vibe)

## Launch Strategy

**Phase 1: Airdrop Only (No Presale)**
- Snapshot early users
- Deploy token + LP (5% of supply)
- Airdrop 30% over 4 weeks
- No presale = no VC dump pressure

**Phase 2: Organic Growth**
- Reward swiping/matching (inflationary for first 6 months)
- Build community before speculation
- Let price discovery happen naturally

**Phase 3: Utility Expansion**
- Premium unlocks go live
- Prediction markets launch
- NFT badges mint

## Risk Management

**Inflation control:** Max 10% new CUCKC/month from rewards  
**Anti-dump:** Vesting + staking incentives  
**Sybil resistance:** Wallet must have 5+ matches to claim airdrop  
**Rug protection:** LP locked 12 months, team vest linear
