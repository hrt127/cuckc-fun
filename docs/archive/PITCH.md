# CUCKC.FUN – Long Romantic Sessions Under the Moonlight

**One‑pager for collaborators**

---

## What It Is

Tinder for chairs.

Swipe on iconic furniture (Saffa legends, global design icons, cursed archetypes), match with your soulmate, earn $CUCKC tokens, and join the chair empire.

Not a startup. Not a side hustle. A batshit creative experiment treating chairs with absurd reverence and occasional financial chaos. Definitely not about cucks.

## Current State (Feb 2026)

✅ Concept is sharp – chair cult, $CUCKC economy, CT/X‑native meme layer  
✅ Prototype exists – browser swipe experiment in `index.html`  
✅ Token/econ ideas – detailed draft in `docs/TOKENOMICS.md`  
✅ Repo – public, MIT, ready for collaborators

**Live demo (staging):** https://cuckc-fun.vercel.app

## The Opportunity

### Immediate (this week)

- Chairs 101 X thread → introduce the cult and the app
- Share prototype with design Twitter + CT to gauge if the joke lands
- Tighten token/econ design based on feedback (keep it fun, not predatory)

### Short‑term (next month)

- Decide chain (Base vs Solana) and launch style (Pump.fun / fair curve / etc.)
- Airdrop plan for early users (track via local storage / simple claims)
- Open community chair submissions + voting on what gets added

### Mid‑term (3–6 months)

- IRL activations (Design Indaba pop‑up, stoep parties, meetups)
- Brand collabs (Haldane, local makers, merch drops)
- On‑chain badge mints (proof of taste / cult status)

### Long‑term (if it works)

- Full chair marketplace (swipe → discover → maybe buy IRL links)
- Prediction games (“most‑swiped chair this week”, etc.)
- Spin‑offs: same pattern for other absurd categories

## Why This Could Work

1. **Zero competition** – no one else is running a serious chair cult.  
2. **Built‑in shareability** – matches and bios are screenshot bait.  
3. **Meme‑native** – crypto degens and design nerds both “get it.”  
4. **Saffa authenticity** – real love for chairs, stoep culture, and chaos.  
5. **Low downside, high jol** – if it flops, we still had fun and learned things.

## What I Need From You

**Your superpower**  
Design, dev, marketing, network, poker/EV brain for the economy, or just being cunty in the right ways.

**Time**  
Roughly 2–4 hours/week to start, with spikes around launch moments.

**Your cut**  
We split whatever matters (token allocation, revenue, IP, braai invites) fairly and explicitly once there’s something real on the table.

**Immediate asks**

- Test the prototype on phone + desktop and give brutal feedback.  
- Help tune chair profiles (too tame / too insane / missing archetypes).  
- Sanity‑check token/econ design (what’s fun vs what’s dumb).  
- Help decide: Base or Solana for first $CUCKC version and how to launch without getting insta‑sniped.

## Next 30 Days If You’re In

**Week 1** – refine prototype, deploy cleanly, soft‑launch to a small circle.  
**Week 2** – run Chairs 101 thread + a few teaser posts, see what bites.  
**Week 3** – lock in token mechanics + launch approach.  
**Week 4** – go/no‑go decision on token launch based on traction and vibes.

## The Vibe

This is not “disrupting the furniture industry” or “the Tinder for X.”

This is about:

- Making people laugh until they snort.  
- Making them weirdly attached to a chair.  
- Maybe spinning that into some upside if the cult catches.  

If it works → we’re the idiots who turned sitting into a cult.  
If it flops → we walk away with better stories and better patterns.

Either way, the chairs get their moment.
